/**
 * ADR-144 tutorial lessons. Pure (no DOM): text uses tokens that the overlay turns into live binding chips:
 *   {A:Action} or {A:Action@Context}  the controls bound to an input action on the active device
 *   {M:menuId}                        how to open a game menu on the active device
 * ADR-275 contextual tips: the old start-to-finish guide is split into one-topic lessons. Each lesson has a `when`
 * trigger (an absolute "has this ever happened" probe check) and shows once, the first time its moment comes up:
 * opening a menu, first gathering, first log, first craft, first build piece, first skill point, getting hungry,
 * a zombie nearby, a broken leg, and so on. Only the Walk tip shows at spawn. "do" lessons finish when the probe
 * shows the player did the thing; "info" lessons wait for Got it. Dismissed lessons never come back (unless the
 * player picks "Play the guide again", which clears the seen list).
