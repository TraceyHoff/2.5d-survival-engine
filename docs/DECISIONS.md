# Architecture Decision Log

Format: number, title, status, context → decision → consequences. All Accepted 2026-10-17 unless noted.

## ADR-001: TypeScript (strict) everywhere
Shared sim code between browser and server; strict flags incl. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Cost: more `!` on typed-array reads.

## ADR-002: pnpm workspaces monorepo, source-first packages
Packages export `src/index.ts`; no build artifacts for libraries; `build` scripts typecheck. Apps bundle. Simpler dev loop; publishing would need a build later.

## ADR-003: Vite for client, Vitest for tests, Node 20 + tsx for server
One transform pipeline; fast tests; server runs same TS.

## ADR-004: WebGL2 renderer behind a `Renderer` interface, owned by Renderer team
Renderer consumes a `RenderFrame` built in `renderPrep`; never mutates sim. WebGPU can come later behind the same interface.

## ADR-005: Sparse-set ECS with SoA typed arrays (no archetypes)
O(1) add/remove, cache-friendly field iteration, trivially serializable. Queries are slower than archetype tables for many-component joins; mitigated by driving from smallest store.

## ADR-006: Entity id = uint32 (20-bit index + 12-bit generation)
Detects stale handles; 1M entity ceiling; generations wrap after 4096 reuses of a slot (acceptable).

## ADR-007: Components are plain numeric data with schemas; no strings
Field types f32/f64/i8–u32; strings/references replaced by numeric ids. Enables binary serialization and typed-array storage.

## ADR-008: Stable numeric component ids by registration order + `networked` flag
Built-ins first (NetId, Owner, Transform, PrevTransform), then gameplay via one shared registration module. Only `networked: true` components replicate.

## ADR-009: Deterministic world schema hash
`world.getSchemaHash()` = FNV-1a over (id, name, networked, sorted field signature incl. quant hints) in registration order. Checked at handshake and embedded in snapshots; mismatch ⇒ reject.

## ADR-010: Built-in NetId {id:u32} and Owner {clientId:u16} in core
Wire identity decoupled from local entity ids; Owner drives prediction and authority. Server assigns NetIds.

## ADR-011: Built-in Transform + PrevTransform; render interpolation
Transform {x,y,z,facing} in float tile units. PrevTransform copied at the start of every tick; renderer lerps Prev→Current by `alpha`.

## ADR-012: Fixed-timestep loop, default 20 Hz, render(world, alpha)
Accumulator + max-steps clamp; time injected via `advance(elapsedMs)`; `createGameLoop(world, {render})` calls `world.step(dt)` then `render(world, alpha)`.

## ADR-013: Deterministic-friendly sim: seeded RNG, no wall clock
mulberry32 `Rng` with snapshot-able u32 state on the world; sim packages forbid `Date.now`, `performance.now`, `Math.random`.

## ADR-014: Ordered system phases; custom named phases; simulation-only replay
Phases input → simulation → postSim → network → renderPrep; `addPhase(name,{after})`; `world.simulate(n, dt, beforeTick)` re-runs only simulation for reconciliation.

## ADR-015: Per-tick change tracking via dirty bitsets
Bit per entity per store set on add/write/markChanged; `world.changed(def)`; cleared at end of `step()`. Raw typed-array writes must call `markChanged`.

## ADR-016: Entity spawn/despawn hooks
`onSpawn`/`onDespawn`; despawn fires before component removal so net can read NetId.

## ADR-017: Schema-driven versioned binary serialization; per-field codecs
Little-endian, sorted field order, snapshot header (magic, version, tick, world hash) and per-component hash. `encodeField/decodeField` over `FieldWriter/FieldReader` so net can layer bit-packing and deltas.

## ADR-018: Quantization hints on schemas, applied on the wire only
`{type, quant:{bits,min,max}}`; `quantize/dequantize/wireValue` helpers; sim state keeps full precision.

## ADR-019: Authoritative server running the same headless sim; client prediction + interpolation
Netcode team owns transport (WebSocket first, WebTransport later) and replication; see `packages/net/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## ADR-020: World resources for global state
Typed singletons (`TimeOfDay`, `Weather`) via `defineResource<T>`; numeric enums only.

## ADR-021: Chunked tile map (32×32), 2:1 iso projection, spatial hash
u16 tile ids + u8 height per chunk with dirty/version; `worldToScreen/screenToWorld`; uniform-grid spatial hash for broad phase.

## ADR-022: Queued event bus delivered at end of tick
Deterministic delivery order; `emitNow` for immediate cases.

## ADR-023: Per-tick component removal tracking
Each store keeps an insertion-ordered, deduped set of entity ids (with the generation at removal time) that lost the component this tick via `world.remove` or `destroy`. `world.removed(def): IterableIterator<Entity>`. Cleared with dirty bits in `clearChanges()` / end of `step()`; `simulate()` leaves it untouched. A same-tick re-add appears in both `removed()` and `changed()`, so consumers process removals first, then changes. Resolves ARCHITECTURE open question on removed-component tracking for delta replication.

## ADR-024: Fixed-length array fields
`{type, length: n}` stored SoA with stride n (`data[f][slot*n+i]`). Accessors: `getArray` (live subarray), `getElement/setElement`; value objects use `number[]`. Serialized element-wise; length is part of the schema signature/hash. Change bits stay per-component (not per element).

## ADR-025: Per-field schema defaults
`{type, default}` applied when a component is first added (arrays filled). Default is part of the schema hash.

## ADR-026: Replay semantics for simulate()
`simulate(ticks, dt, {systems?, beforeTick?, startTick?, keepEvents?})`: sets `world.tick = startTick + i` per replay (default startTick = `tick - ticks`, the last `ticks` completed ticks, consistent with `step()` running systems at the pre-increment tick), restores tick afterwards, sets `isReplaying`, discards queued events by default, can restrict to named simulation systems. `world.predicted: Set<Entity>` lets systems skip non-predicted entities. Legacy `simulate(n, dt, fn)` kept.

## ADR-027: Keyed deterministic RNG streams
`world.rngFor(key, entity?)` = fresh mulberry32 seeded by hash(world seed, tick, key, entity). Stateless w.r.t. the global `world.rng`, so prediction can reproduce rolls. Peers must pass a shared id (NetId), not local entity ids.

## ADR-028: Environment singleton entity
Core creates `world.environment` with `NetId = ENV_NET_ID (1)`, `TimeOfDay {t f64, dayLengthTicks u32, day u32}` and `Weather {kind u8, intensity f32, ticksRemaining u32}`, both networked. `world.env(def)` is a live view (writes mark changed). Weather kinds are gameplay data (core enum removed). Net server allocates NetIds from 2; net client maps ENV_NET_ID onto its own environment entity. `resource(TimeOfDay)` remains as a deprecated alias of `env()`.

## ADR-029: System order introspection
`world.systemOrder(): {phase, name}[]`.

## ADR-030: Generic input frames and commands
`defineActions(names)` → bit masks (≤32) owned by gameplay; `InputFrame {tick, actions u32, aimX, aimY, commands}`; commands are schema records (`defineCommand(name, schema)`) with ids from a `CommandRegistry` (registration order, u8). Binary codec `encodeInputFrame/decodeInputFrame`. Legacy `Action` masks kept, deprecated.

## ADR-031: Shared spatial index
`@engine/world` `installSpatialIndex(world)` registers resource `SpatialIndexRes` and postSim system `spatialIndex`, updated incrementally from Transform change/removal records; `queryRadius`, `queryRect` with exact tests.

## ADR-032: Unbounded chunk coordinates with string ChunkKey
Chunk coords are signed int32; `chunkKey(cx,cy)` = `"cx,cy"` (string, stable wire/debug format), `chunkOf(pos)`, `chunkKeyOf(x,y)`, `parseChunkKey`. Strings over packed numbers because int32×int32 does not fit a JS number exactly; measured cost is negligible at interest-update rates.

## ADR-033: Float precision policy
Transform stays f32 tile units. Guaranteed ≤1/256-tile precision within ±65,536 tiles of the origin (`F32_SAFE_TILE_RANGE`). Larger worlds run sims relative to a `WorldOrigin` (region/camera rebasing at chunk corners) and persist chunk-relative positions (chunk codec does this).

## ADR-034: ChunkManager streaming with pluggable providers and LRU
Active set = union of squares (Chebyshev radius) around interest sources, with an unload margin (hysteresis), a per-update load budget, and an LRU of inactive chunks. Stable hooks `onLoad(chunk, nodes)` / `onUnload(chunk)` (persist there). `ChunkProvider.load` (sync) — `ProceduralGenerator` (seeded value-noise biomes + resource node placements) is the stub provider.

## ADR-035: Persistent component flag + versioned binary chunk codec
`defineComponent(..., {persistent: true})` (Transform is persistent). `encodeChunk/decodeChunk` v1: RLE tiles, heights, anchored building instances, persistent-component table with schema hashes, entities with chunk-relative Transform. No storage backend in core/world.

## ADR-036: Chunk membership + InterestGrid for relevancy
`ChunkMembership` maintains entity→chunk incrementally from Transform change/removal records. `InterestGrid` computes per-client relevant chunks (radius + hysteresis) and entities, emitting `enteredChunks/leftChunks/entered/left` each update; cost O(clients × chunks-in-radius + nearby entities). `setAlwaysRelevant` for own player/environment.

## ADR-037: Hierarchical spatial index
`ChunkedSpatialIndex`: chunk map → 8×8 grid of 4-tile cells; memory proportional to occupied chunks; rect/radius queries visit only overlapping chunks/cells. The flat `SpatialHash`/`installSpatialIndex` remain for small worlds.

## ADR-038: Building grid as data structures only
`BuildingGrid` with per-chunk `StructureLayer` (sparse occupancy keyed by level 0..15, layer 0..3, local tile), multi-tile rotated footprints spanning chunks, collision/occupancy/rect queries, support graph (`supportsOf/dependentsOf/neighborsOf`), `stabilityRule` hook, sub-tile sockets (1/4 tile) with `snap`. `BuildPieceDef` is data (`loadBuildPieces`): footprint, levels, layer, solid, cost [{resource, amount}], sockets, hp. Rules belong to Survival Systems.

## ADR-039: Stable string-key → numeric id registry with lock tables
`StableIdRegistry.assign(keys, lock)` keeps locked ids and appends new keys after the max (sorted), so content additions never renumber; `hash` covers all pairs. Used by assets (`ids.lock.json`) and build pieces. `world.addSchemaSalt(name, hash)` mixes such hashes into `getSchemaHash()`.

## ADR-040: Data-driven asset manifests (@engine/assets)
JSON manifest v1: atlases (grid frames) and sprites (category ∈ character/zombie/item/equipment/resource/building/tile, anchor, animations with frames/fps/directions 1|4|8/dirStride). `loadManifest` validates (all issues reported), assigns stable u16 ids, `AssetRegistry.frame()` resolves atlas rects by facing/time; `installAssetHash(world, reg)`. Placeholder cartoony atlases generated by a dependency-free script.

## ADR-041: Test harness and CI
Core exports `createTestWorld`, `stepN`, `FakeClock`, `TEST_SEED`. `@engine/testkit` `createHarness` runs an in-process `NetServer` + N `NetClient`s over Netcode's loopback transport on one fake clock. `pnpm check` = recursive typecheck + vitest; GitHub Actions workflow runs install, check and build (not pushed yet).

## ADR-042: Derived TimeOfDay (no per-tick replication)
`TimeOfDay {dayLengthTicks u32, epochTick i32}`; fraction/hours/day are derived from `world.tick` by `timeOfDay(world, tick?)` → `{t, hours, day, tickOfDay, dayLengthTicks}`. Jumps go through `setTimeOfDay(world, hours, day?)` / `setDayLength(world, ticks)`, which rewrite `epochTick` (the only time the component changes and replicates). Replaces the f64 `t` that cost 64 bits/tick per client (Netcode §12). Gameplay's clock system now only emits phase-change events.

## ADR-043: Weather.endsAtTick
`Weather {kind u8, intensity f32, endsAtTick u32}`: weather lasts while `tick < endsAtTick`; replaces the per-tick `ticksRemaining` countdown (32 bits/tick per client).

## ADR-044: Transform wire quantization
`Transform.z` q10 over [0, `TRANSFORM_Z_MAX` = 64] tiles (~0.0625 tile), `facing` q8 over [-π, π] (~1.4°). Sim keeps f32; values outside the range are clamped on the wire, so systems keep facing normalized (`normalizeAngle`) and heights within 0..64 tiles. x/y stay f32 (chunk-relative q16 is a future option).

## ADR-045: Multiple interest viewpoints per client
`InterestGrid.setClientViewpoints(id, [{x, y, r?}])`; the relevant chunk/entity set is the union, hysteresis is applied per viewpoint. `setClient(id, x, y, r?)` remains as the single-viewpoint shorthand.

## ADR-046: Extended asset manifest (sounds, vfx, UI, emissive, variants, building sprites)
Manifest v1 gains optional `sounds` (file variants, volume, pitchJitter, loop, category sfx|ambience|ui), `vfx` (sprite/anim ref, lifetime, particle params, blend normal|additive|multiply), atlas `nineSlice` insets and `emissive` flag (`<image>_emissive.png`, same layout), `tintSets`, `palettes` (source→target color maps), `variantSets` (character/zombie base + tint/palette/sprite variants) and building sprite data (`piece`, footprint, layer, `frames[rotation][damageStage]`, cross-checked by `validateBuildingSprites`). Ids are stable per namespace (sprites, sounds, vfx, variants, tints, palettes) via `StableIdRegistry`; `ids.lock.json` is namespaced (flat legacy sprite locks migrate automatically) and the registry hash covers all namespaces.

## ADR-047: Generic emitters and field sampling
`@engine/world` `Emitter {kind u8, radius f32, strength f32, falloff u8 (Constant|Linear|Quadratic)}` (networked) + `EmitterIndex` (postSim system `emitterIndex`, per-kind `ChunkedSpatialIndex`, incremental from change/removal records). `sampleField(kind, x, y, z?)` sums contributions; `nearestEmitters(kind, x, y, n, z?)`. Optional `OcclusionFn`; `buildingOcclusion(grid, {transmit, kinds})` makes solid building tiles block (walls block heat). Kinds and meaning (heat, light-as-warmth, smell, noise) are gameplay's.

## ADR-048: Shelter and exposure queries on BuildingGrid
`isCovered(tx, ty, z)` (roof-layer piece above), `enclosure(tx, ty, z, maxCells)` (bounded flood fill bounded by solid wall-layer pieces; `{enclosed, roofed, size}`; cache shared by all cells of a room, invalidated by `version` bump on place/remove), `exposure(x, y, z, windDir?)` heuristic in [0,1]. Configurable `roofLayers` / `wallLayers`. Gameplay decides what exposure means.

## ADR-049: Wind on Weather
`Weather` gains `windDir` (radians toward which wind blows, q8 [-π,π]) and `windSpeed` (tiles/s, q8 [0,32]); networked with the environment singleton.

## ADR-050: Climate sampling with gameplay-owned models
`BaseClimateSource.baseClimate(tx, ty)` → `{temperature, humidity, altitude}`; `ProceduralGenerator` implements it from biome bands (+ large-scale noise, altitude = tile height) and `chunkClimate`. `installClimate(world, source, model?)`, `setClimateModel`, `climateAt(world, x, y)` = `model.sample(base, {time: timeOfDay, weather})`. `DefaultClimateModel` is a simple placeholder; Survival Systems supplies its own `ClimateModel`.

## ADR-051: Scheduled (slow) systems and lazy decay
`addSystem(phase, name, fn, {every, offset})`: runs when `tick ≡ offset (mod every)` with `dt × every`; default offset = hash(name) % every for deterministic staggering; honored by `simulate()`. `decayAt(createdTick, rate, tick, {initial, mode})` and `decayReachesAt` support lazy decay: store createdTick/lastUpdateTick per item/slot and evaluate on read instead of per-tick updates.

## ADR-052: Generic modifier stacks
`defineModifierStack(name, capacity)` → fixed-capacity array component (stat u8 [0 = empty], op Add|Mul, value f32, expiresAtTick u32 [0 = permanent]); `addModifier` (refreshes same stat+op, reuses expired slots), `removeModifiers`, `evaluate(world, e, def, stat, base)` = (base + Σadd) × Πmul over live entries, `pruneModifiers` (slow system). Stat ids belong to gameplay.

## ADR-053: Stable PlayerId and server-authoritative GroupRegistry
`PlayerId {id u32}` (persistent, networked) is the account identity; `Owner.clientId` stays transient. Parties/clans live in a `GroupRegistry` (world data, not components): `{id, kind u8, members playerId→role u8, version}`, versioned binary `encode/decode`, and a bounded change log (`seq`, `changesSince(seq)` → deltas or `undefined` = resync, `apply` for client mirrors). `Membership {partyId, clanId}` and `OwnedBy {playerId, groupId}` components mirror it on entities.

## ADR-054: Generic permissions, area claims and zones
Gameplay defines action bits with `definePermissionActions`. `can(world, actor, target, action)` order: gameplay rules (allow/deny/no opinion) → `AccessList` (deny wins, then allow) → `OwnedBy` (owner player, group role ≥ `minRole[action]`) → claim at target position (owner group; `claimOutsiderMask`) → `defaultAllow`. `canAt` covers placement. `ClaimRegistry` buckets rect claims by 32-tile cells (chunk grid) for O(1) lookup; `zoneAt(x, y)` unions `ZoneFlag`s (Raidable, PvP, Safe, NoBuild).

## ADR-055: Damage pipeline; lag compensation stays in net
`DamagePipeline` with ordered `pre`/`mitigation`/`post` hooks over a `DamageEvent` record `{source, target, amount, type u8, tick}`, `DamageApplied` event, and `canDamage` (gameplay hooks → safe zones → optional PvP zone → shared party/clan unless `friendlyFire`). No Transform history in core: Netcode's `PositionHistory.getPositionAt` / `rangeCheckWithSlack` is the lag-compensation API.

## ADR-056: Container adapters and transactions over gameplay inventories
No core container component: gameplay's Inventory is canonical. Core defines `SlotContainer {capacity, getSlot, setSlot}` adapters registered per component (`scalarFieldsContainer`, `arrayFieldsContainer` helpers), a `maxStack` hook and validators. `Transaction` records undo per touched slot; `transaction(world, fn)` commits on ok, rolls back on failure/throw; `transfer()` is an atomic single move (merge/swap).

## ADR-057: Scheduler, timed job queues and recipe data
`Scheduler` = binary heap on (tick, seq), deterministic, not persisted (persist due ticks, re-arm). `defineJobQueue(name, cap)` array component {recipeId, startTick, endTick, count, state, remaining}; `JobQueues` arms one timer per head job (no per-tick work), with pause/resume/cancel (`onCancel` refund hook) and `rearmAll` after load. `@engine/assets` `loadRecipes` reads gameplay's recipes.json format as-is (+ outputs, unlocks, skill, tags) with StableIdRegistry ids; rules stay in gameplay.

## ADR-058: Chat data model and message-only strings
Channel kinds Global/Local/Party/Clan/Trade/Whisper/System; `ChannelRegistry` derives recipients from groups/proximity, validates (membership, mute, size, tick token bucket); `MuteList` (blocks + timed mutes, JSON). `writeString/readString` (varint length + UTF-8, max bytes) exist for message records only — never component schemas. Net owns transport.

## ADR-059: Server-side command handlers
`CommandHandlers.on(def, {permission?, validate?, handle})`; queued commands are processed in the input-phase system `commands` ordered by (actor, seq, arrival), skipped during replay; failures emit `CommandRejected {reason}`, success `CommandAccepted`. Complements net's transport-level `NetServer.onCommand`.

## ADR-060: Tile and building change records for replication
`Chunk.set` records `(index, old, new)` triples (only when the value changes) and registers the chunk with its owning TileMap; `tileChanges()` drains per chunk (sorted by key, with `version`), and evicted/unloaded chunks are forgotten. `encodeTileDelta/decodeTileDelta/applyTileDelta` give a compact wire form (u32 version, u16 n, n × (u16 index, u16 tile)), collapsing repeated edits. `BuildingGrid` mutations go through `place`/`remove`/`setHp`/`damage`, which record `Placed/Removed/Hp` changes drained by `buildingChanges()` (`recordChanges = false` for bulk loads). `world.setField` always marks dirty (via `ComponentStore.write`; covered by a test). Single consumer (net) drains once per tick.

## ADR-061: Async chunk providers
`AsyncChunkProvider.load` may return a Promise; `ChunkManager` accepts either. In-flight loads are tracked per key with a token: never requested twice, count toward `pendingLoads`, dropped (`stats.asyncDropped`) if the chunk leaves the keep set or is evicted before arrival, errors counted and retried on a later update. `settle()` awaits in-flight loads. The sync `ChunkProvider` type is unchanged, so existing callers (persist) are unaffected.

## ADR-062: encodeChunk fast path
Header, RLE tiles, height and buildings are written into a reused module-level DataView (no tuple/instance array allocation); the entity section still uses BinaryWriter. Format v1 unchanged and byte-identical to the previous encoder. 3000-piece chunk: warm 0.885 → 0.07–0.12 ms, cold 4.5 → 1.3–1.5 ms (box measurements).

## ADR-063: World.removeSystem
`world.removeSystem(name): boolean` removes a named system from all phases (tests, toggling debug systems). Requested by Netcode tests.

## ADR-064: Art pack is default content; placeholders are a fixture; typed schema additions
`packages/assets/pack/` (Art & Assets) is the default manifest (`DEFAULT_MANIFEST`, `fetchDefaultManifest`, `@engine/assets/node`); `sample/` stays in place as the placeholder test fixture (render's debug mount and Art's pack test reference it), with placeholder-specific assertions in `test/fixture.test.ts`. Added `lock:ids:pack`. Schema: optional `critter` category (`OPTIONAL_CATEGORIES`, so required-coverage checks don't break), typed `rotationArt` (mirror 1/2/4 rows with flipX derivation, unique4 = 4 rows), `building.states`, `sway`, and sound loop points. Pillar layer reconciled to 1 per INTEGRATION.md (fixture test fixed).

## ADR-065: Building piece state
`PieceInstance.state` (0..63) via `BuildingGrid.setState` (records `State` change) and `place(..., state)`. Stored in the chunk codec rot byte's upper 6 bits, so format v1 and persisted data stay compatible.

## ADR-066: Clan banners in GroupRegistry
`Group.banner {shape u8, pattern u8, colors [u32, u32], emblemId u16}` via `setBanner(group, banner|null)`, logged as a `banner` delta and saved in GroupRegistry format v2 (v1 still decodes).

## ADR-067: Height convention
`FLOOR_HEIGHT_LEVELS = 3`: one building floor = 3 terrain levels (16 px each, walls 48 px). Transform.z is terrain levels; BuildingGrid z is a floor index; helpers `floorToTerrainZ` / `terrainZToFloor`.

## ADR-068: Slot item state (durability, createdTick) and merge rules
`Slot` gains optional `durability` (u16, 0 = n/a) and `createdTick` (u32), carried by adapters (`arrayFieldsContainer {durability, createdTick}`, `scalarFieldsContainer {durabilities, createdTicks}`), `transfer`, swaps, `Transaction.add/remove/set` and rollback. Merges go through `ContainerRegistry.mergeMeta` (default `defaultMergeMeta`: count-weighted average createdTick, min durability). `maxStack(item, state)` sees the slot state; items with durability > 0 stack to 1 by default, and custom hooks passed to `installContainers` keep that unless `durabilityStacks: true`. Moving a whole stack onto a same-item slot that cannot absorb it now swaps the two slots (e.g. two tools) instead of failing; partial moves still fail with `stack_full`.

## ADR-069: World.isRegistered and recipe station ids
`world.isRegistered(def)` is public. `loadRecipes` auto-assigns stable station ids (`registry.stationIds`, "none" = 0, optional `stationLock`) when no station lookup is given; an explicit lookup stays strict. The batch-10 recipes test failure came from the test's own hard-coded station table (campfire/workbench only) and the move of recipe ids into gameplay's `ids.lock.json`. No data was missing.

## ADR-070: Atlas scale pages, generalized mask pages, sprite tints
Atlases get `pages: [{scale, image}]`, a list of resolution variants. A list of scales covers 1.5×/2×/3× and keeps `image` as the scale-1 page. `pickPage(atlas, dpr)` chooses the smallest scale ≥ dpr. `FrameRef` carries `pages`/`masks`; `AssetRegistry.scaled(ref, dpr)` resolves the rect. `masks {emissive?, sheen?, sway?, tintmask?}` generalizes emissive pages (UV-sampled, scale-independent); `emissive: boolean` remains as shorthand and `emissiveImage` as an alias. Sprites get typed `tints: Record<name, {color, strength, mode?}>` and `sway.mask`. The survival_fx `x_survival` block is a deprecated alias mapped by `applyLegacySurvival`, with warnings returned from `loadManifest`.

## ADR-071: Unified cross-device input (@engine/input)
**Decision:** A new client-only package with a DOM-free core (devices as string-path controls, JSON binding profiles per device class, a priority context stack with consume/passthrough/textEntry, interaction state machines, processors), a thin browser adapter, and a single sampling point per sim tick into core `InputState`. Gameplay-specific behavior comes in through hooks (autoTarget, aimAssist, contextAction, ghostSnap, holdCancel), so rules stay in gameplay.
**Why:** Keeps the sim deterministic and netcode unchanged, makes every feature Node-testable with FakeDevice/replay, and lets remapping and touch layouts be data.
**Alternatives:** Per-device ad-hoc listeners in the client (current state; doesn't scale to contexts or touch); framework-bound input (ties UI tech).

## ADR-072: InputFrame v2 (append-only)
**Decision:** Append a flags byte + optional q8 `moveX/moveY`, `aimMode`, q8 `ghostNudgeX/Y`, and u32 `edges` after the legacy layout; `INPUT_FRAME_VERSION = 2`, codecs take an explicit version so v1 peers still decode. Digital move bits are always set as fallback; hold bits keep gameplay's order and only append (Crouch, Charge); edges are pulses for one tick.
**Why:** Analog movement for gamepad/touch and explicit aim semantics without renumbering bits or command ids.

## ADR-073: Default input contract and glyph manifest
**Decision:** Ship Survival Systems' contract as `packages/input/profiles/*.json` (generated by `scripts/gen-profiles.py`) plus `defaults.ts` (actions, contexts, frame mapping, focus actions, touch layouts). Context actions are client events, not frame bits; PlaceCmd is only sent on PlaceConfirm. Prompt glyphs come from a manifest `glyphs` map keyed `kbm.*`/`gamepad.<layout>.*`/`touch.*`. Sprite tints gain `saturation` (default 1, applied before the color mode).
**Why:** Gameplay files are blocked this batch; data-first defaults are easy for gameplay to take over or override.

## ADR-074: Crafter attribution as a plain slot field + PlayerNameRegistry
**Decision:** `Slot.crafterId` is a u32 `PlayerId` (0 = none) stored as a plain per-slot component array, like `durability`/`createdTick`. Stacks merge only when item, crafterId and durability all match (`sameStack`), in core `Transaction` and in gameplay's own slot ops. Display names live in `PlayerNameRegistry` (seq + change log, binary encode/decode), and are resolved at display time.
**Why:** Netcode asked for it: one fixed-width field goes through the existing schema-driven net and chunk encoding with no side-table lifecycle (interning, GC, id remapping on load), and it is cheap (4 B/slot). Replicating names once per player keeps per-item cost at an id.
**Alternatives:** Interned metadata id + side table (more flexible for quality/signature, but needs its own persistence and replication; quality/signature can be added later as further optional slot fields or a side table keyed by a future `meta` value). Name strings on items (unbounded, goes stale on rename).
**Consequence:** Adding the field changes the Inventory/Container schema hash; persisted chunks need a migration or a fresh world (Netcode).

## ADR-075: Trade stalls as core primitives (TradeStall, atomicPurchase, SaleLedger)
**Decision:** Core provides a `TradeStall` component (listings + `revision`), permission-checked stock/withdraw/listing ops via `can()` with gameplay-supplied action bits, an atomic `buyFromStall`/`atomicPurchase` over `transaction()`, and an append-only `SaleLedger`. Ownership reuses `OwnedBy` (player or clan group). There are no balance rules.
**Why:** The purchase needs to be all-or-nothing across three containers, and rank checks should reuse the unified permission path. A revision counter lets net reject stale purchases cheaply.
**Alternatives:** Gameplay-only stall logic (each rule set would reimplement atomicity); escrow entities (more state, no gain over a transaction).
**Note:** Survival has gameplay-side `StallHeader/Listings/StallLedger` components in progress. They can either adopt `TradeStall` or keep theirs and call `atomicPurchase` + `can()` directly; core does not require its own component.

## ADR-076: Sprite attach points
**Decision:** Optional `attach` on sprites and `frameAttach[frame]` per-frame overrides (frame keys override sprite keys), resolved onto `FrameRef.attach`. Units are px offsets from the pivot at 1x scale; x is mirrored when `flipX` (`AssetRegistry.attachPoint`).
**Why:** Renderer needs stable anchors for stall display slots, price tags, name labels and vfx sockets without hard-coding per-sprite offsets.

## ADR-077: Two-tone clan tint via palette index, not tint2
**Decision:** Add manifest `clanPalettes` (primary/secondary pairs). `BuildPiece.tint` stays a u8 index (gameplay already stores it that way); the renderer maps tintmask R to primary and G to secondary. There is no `tint2` field.
**Why:** A single u8 per piece replicates and persists cheaply, keeps both colors consistent per clan, and lets a clan recolor by changing one index instead of rewriting every piece. A raw RGB `tint2` would double per-piece state and still need an index for UI pickers.
**Alternatives:** `tint2` u32 next to `tint` (free colors, but bigger and unsynchronized); deriving secondary from `tintSets.clan_secondary` (two parallel lists that can drift apart).

## ADR-078: Manifest schema batch for clan/raid art
**Decision:** Add mask file/size validation through injected IO (`validateAssetFiles`, so `loadManifest` stays browser-pure), per-rotation animation rows (`rotations`, with `<anim>_r1` kept as a fallback), `building.crackOverlay`, `building.stateVfx` (reusing ADR-076 attach points), vfx `stretch: velocity`, and an optional `decal` category with first-match autotile rules plus a required fallback. Everything is optional, and existing packs validate unchanged (pvp_clan fragment: 0 warnings, 0 file issues).
**Why:** These replace naming hacks and renderer-side conventions with validated data. First-match masked rules cover 4-way edges (16 tiles) and 8-way blob sets without a fixed tileset layout.

## ADR-079: ClaimRegistry encode/decode in core
**Decision:** `ClaimRegistry.encode()`, `static decode(bytes)`, `load(bytes)` (replaces the contents in place) and the read-only getter `nextClaimId`. Format v1 is byte-identical to persist's committed `claims` blob (magic "CLLM", u8 version, u32 nextId, u32 defaultFlags, u32 count, count × (u32 id, u32 ownerGroup, 4 × f64 rect, u32 flags, i32 priority)), so existing saves load unchanged and no migration is needed. Persist can drop its private-field fallback (`claimsNextId`) and the add/remove nextId trick and call these methods instead.

## ADR-080: Character customization as a cosmetic paper-doll component, separate from equipment
**Decision:** The manifest gets optional `bodyTypes`, `wearables`, `skinTones`, `hairColors` and `clothingColors` sections, loaded into `AssetRegistry.cosmetics` (a `CosmeticCatalog`, with its own `wearables` lock section). Core gets an `Appearance` component (networked + persistent): `bodyType` u8, `skinTone` u8, `version` u16 (wrapping change counter), `parts` u16×8 (0 = none), and `primary`/`secondary` u8×8 palette indices over the fixed slot order `WEARABLE_SLOTS` (hair, hat, accessory, top, bottom, shoes, face, eyes; new slots can only be appended). It also gets the pure helpers `defaultAppearance`, `validateAppearance` and `resolveLayers`. Core only sees a structural `CosmeticCatalogLike`, so core does not depend on assets. Gameplay armor can optionally name a cosmetic override (`equipCosmetic`) on item defs. That is documented here but not wired yet.
**Why:** A full look costs 42 bytes, uses palette indices (the same as clan tint, ADR-077) and validates on the server cheaply. Keeping cosmetics apart from equipment means a stat change never breaks how a character looks, and a cosmetic can never carry stats. The tintmask R/G channel convention is reused, so no new mask kind is needed.
**Version counter:** the Renderer caches `resolveLayers` output per entity, keyed by `Appearance.version`. Every writer must call `setAppearance(world, e, value)`, which writes the whole value and bumps `version` (wrapping u16). Direct `world.set` or `setElement` on Appearance is forbidden, because the cache would go stale. A per-component dirty bit wouldn't work here: it is cleared every tick and isn't available on clients after replication.
**Alternatives:** One entity per worn part (too many entities to replicate); raw RGB colors (bigger, and not pickable from curated lists); deriving the look from equipment (couples art to balance).

## ADR-081: Renderer contracts — StallDisplay, 1-based clan tint, buildPieceVisual, mergeManifests
**Decision:**
1. **StallDisplay** (core, `networked: true`, not persistent): `item` u16, `qty` u16, `price` u32, `currency` u16, each × `STALL_LISTINGS` (8), mirroring TradeStall listing rows slot-for-slot. No scope hook is registered, so net broadcasts it to every observer (listings are viewer-only data). It is optional: `addStallDisplay(world, e)` registers/adds/syncs it, and `syncStallDisplay(world, e)` copies TradeStall rows (marks changed only on a diff). `setStallListing`, `stockStall`, `withdrawStall` and `buyFromStall` call it automatically through the revision bump.
2. **Clan tint indexing:** `BuildPiece.tint` = 0 means no clan tint, and 1..N means `clanPalettes[tint - 1]`. Out-of-range values give no tint (no modulo). `BuildPiece.paint` overrides `tint` when it is not 0, using the same indexing. Implemented as `AssetRegistry.clanPaletteForTint(tint)`. `clanPalette(index)` stays 0-based on the raw array.
3. **buildPieceVisual(registry, piece, opts)** in `@engine/assets` is the only gameplay BuildPiece → render mapping. Inputs: `{type, rot, tint, paint, damageStage?, state?, level?}`, plus opts `{ghost?, pieceKey?}`. Output: `{visualId, rotation, damageStage, stateIndex, frame, crack?, level, layer, ghost, tintIndex, palette?}`. Uses manifest building defs (`building.piece`, rotation rows/flipX via `buildingFrame`, `states`, `crackOverlay` stage1..3, `layer`). It lives in assets because render already depends on assets, and gameplay can depend on assets (assets → core only), so there is no cycle. Core cannot host it because it needs the registry.
4. **mergeManifests(fragments, {strict?, resolve?})** in `@engine/assets` replaces render's `mergeManifestFragments` stub and the collision scan in Art's `validate_fragment.ts`. Every keyed array section (including wearables, skin/hair/clothing colors, palettes, decals, clanPalettes and unknown future ones) and the record sections (`glyphs`, `bodyTypes`) merge in order. The first definition wins, and every collision is reported as `{section, key, fragments}`. `strict` throws `ManifestMergeError`.
**Why:** The Renderer needs a stable, tested contract instead of local adapters. 0 is the natural "unset" value for a u8 tint, and modulo would silently give a clan the wrong colors.

## ADR-082: Cosmetics contract extensions (layers, 8 facings, frameMeta, expressions, tintNeutral, body defaults)
**Decision:** Optional extensions to ADR-080, all backward compatible: wearable `layers[]`; 8-entry or compass `layerByDir` with `directionIndex8`; sprite/animation `frameMeta` anchors with registry accessors (replacing `hands.json`); `faceAnims`/`expressions` plus a runtime `expression` option on `resolveLayers`; default `tintMode: multiply` with `tintNeutral` 0.78 and `out = base * mix(1, color/tintNeutral, strength)`; per-body `cosmeticDefaults` and `requiredSlots`; `displayName`/`locKey`; `outline: "body" | "none"` (booleans still accepted); UI widget types `charpreview` and `cosmeticslot` with `validateUiScreen`. See docs/CHARACTER_CUSTOMIZATION.md.
**Why:** The renderer already draws 8 facings, and Art needs multi-piece garments, per-frame hand anchors and expressions. With a neutral grey, an authored mask reproduces the picked color exactly. The Appearance wire format is unchanged (still 42 bytes).
**Known gap:** the render shader's multiply doesn't divide by tintNeutral yet, and its layer cache buckets by 4 facings. Those are Renderer follow-ups.
## ADR-090: Game modes and a deterministic ambient PopulationSpawner
**Decision.** `createGameServer({ mode })` takes `"singleplayer" | "multiplayer"`. `gameModeConfig(mode)` returns `{ mode, humanBots }`, and `humanBots` is true only in singleplayer. local.ts (the in-browser server) defaults to singleplayer. The Node server defaults to multiplayer (`--mode` / `GAME_MODE`). In multiplayer, no virtual-player host is installed, the human_bot spawn entry is filtered out, `markVirtual` is refused, and the local `bots` option is ignored. Ambient zombies, animals and bots come from one `PopulationSpawner` (in @engine/world). Its tables are data in gameplay/data/spawns.json (population.json was replaced; see gameplay DESIGN §22):
- density per loaded chunk, tile include/exclude lists, time-of-day weights, minimum and maximum player distance, and per-chunk and global caps
- spawning is blocked by unwalkable tiles, structures, the BuildingGrid and claims
- despawn beyond `despawnDistance` from every non-bot player, unless the entity is persistent
- `rngFor("pop:<kind>:<chunk>")` on a 2 s cadence

The legacy per-player zombie spawner turns itself off when population owns zombies (`PopulationZombies`).
**Why.** One mechanism with data in gameplay, and it is deterministic and testable. Multiplayer stays bot-free by construction rather than by convention.

## ADR-091: Human bots are virtual players driven by a data-driven agent framework
**Decision.** A human bot is a real player session: a loopback NetClient with its own replica, account (ClaimAccount derived from its identity) and name. It is driven by `AgentController` (@engine/core/ai), and its only output is `AgentOutput`. local.ts maps that to the same `Act` buttons, aim and chat a human sends. Bots never touch the server World. The framework provides:
- perception (sight cone, hearing, memory decay) and a blackboard
- utility behaviors with curves, traits and schedule bonuses
- a budgeted, round-robin think
- reaction delay, aim error, jitter, path wobble, idle pauses and look-around
- rate-limited templated chat with a pluggable `ChatProvider` (an LLM hook; the engine never calls external services)

Identity is persisted in the `agents` record namespace. Gameplay supplies `referenceBehaviors()`, and you add more with `survivorController({ extra })`.
**Why.** Bots go through the same authority, validation and anti-cheat path as humans, so whatever they can do, a human could have done.
