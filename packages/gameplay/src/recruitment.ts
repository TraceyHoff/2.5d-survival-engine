/**
 * Task 22 AI-human recruitment: wandering AI survivors (bots) can be hired by a player to work for them.
 *
 * A bot that can be hired carries the `Worker` component (networked + persistent, on the bot's player entity):
 *   wantedItem — the one item the bot asks for (1 unit), picked once from WANTED_ITEM_KEYS as a tick-independent
 *     fnv1a hash of the bot's stable PlayerId (same account -> same want on every peer and every session) and
 *     never re-rolled; a bot from an old save gets one from `recruitmentSystem` on first sight. (world.rngFor is
 *     tick-seeded and would re-roll every tick, so it is NOT used here.)
 *   owner      — the hiring player's PlayerId (0 = for hire).
 *   job        — the assigned WorkerJob (Gather / Farm / Defend / Craft / Maintain / Follow; None while for hire).
 *   homeX/Y    — where the bot was hired: the work anchor when the owner has no claim (see workerAnchor).
 *
 * Hire is server-authoritative: `hireWorker` re-checks owner === 0 and removes the wanted item *before* setting
 * the owner, so a race between two players hires at most one of them and never consumes an item without hiring.
 * The bot's Tribe is set to the owner's tribe at hire so it can use the owner's claimed base (containers, repair,
 * farming all gate on `hasPrivilege`, which reads the actor's Tribe); dismissed workers get that Tribe cleared
 * again when it is still the owner's tribe. Unclaimed land needs no tribe (no zones -> every() is true).
 *
 * The multiplayer toggle lives in WorldRules.aiHumans (see hordes.ts setWorldRules/worldRules): when off, bots do
 * not spawn in multiplayer (gameModeConfig) and hires/new assignments are refused (AiHumansOff). Existing bots and workers keep
 * working when it is flipped — removing them would destroy player-paid hires. Singleplayer is unaffected by the
 * toggle in the sense that it is on by default there too; the same setting covers both modes.
